# 🚦Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System :

## 📌 Objective

To develop an intelligent traffic signal system that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic density, aiming to reduce congestion, waiting time, and fuel consumption at intersections.

## 📊 Dataset

* Source: \[Specify source, e.g., open-source traffic datasets or simulated data]
* Content:

  * Traffic flow data (vehicles per lane)
  * Time-stamped vehicle counts
  * Lane-wise vehicle density
  * Signal phase timings
* Format: CSV/JSON or real-time feed via camera/sensor simulations


## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   Real-time or simulated data on vehicle density per lane was collected using cameras or sensors.

2. **Preprocessing:**

   * Cleaned and normalized traffic data
   * Aggregated vehicle count per lane at fixed intervals

3. **Traffic Analysis & Signal Adjustment Logic:**

   * Implemented a dynamic timing algorithm based on:

     * Vehicle density per lane
     * Average waiting time
   * Used rule-based or ML-based optimization to determine green light duration dynamically

4. **System Implementation**

   * Developed using Python (or another language)
   * Integrated with simulation tools or hardware interface
   * User interface to visualize traffic signal changes and traffic flow (optional)

## ✅ Results

* Up to **30–50% reduction in average vehicle waiting time** compared to fixed signal systems
* Improved **traffic throughput** at peak hours
* Demonstrated better handling of uneven traffic distribution across lanes
* Enhanced **fuel efficiency and emission control** due to reduced idle time

## 🏁 Conclusion

The Adaptive Traffic Signal System demonstrates how real-time data and intelligent decision-making can significantly enhance urban traffic management. By prioritizing high-density lanes and dynamically adjusting signal timings, the system reduces congestion and improves traffic flow efficiency. This approach can be scaled and deployed in smart cities for sustainable urban mobility.
